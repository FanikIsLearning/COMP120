It encourages team structures and attitudes that make communication more facile. 
It emphasizes rapid delivery of operational software and deemphasizes the importance of intermediate work products (not always a good thing); 
it adopts the customer as a part of the development team and works to eliminate the “us and them” attitude that continues to pervade many software projects; 
it recognizes that planning in an uncertain world has its limits and that a project plan must be flexible.

Agility can be applied to any software process. However, to accomplish this, 
it is essential that the process be designed in a way that allows the project team to adapt tasks and to streamline them, 
conduct planning in a way that understands the fluidity of an agile development approach, 
eliminate all but essential work products and keep them lean, 
and emphasize an incremental delivery strategy that gets working software to the customer as rapidly as feasible for the product type and operational 
environment.
